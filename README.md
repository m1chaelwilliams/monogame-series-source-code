# MonoGame Tutorial Series Source Code

This repository holds the source code for some episodes where it would help. Each folder is named __similarly__ to the title of the corresponding video.

## Contributing

If you find that a video needs source code and doesn't have it here, please feel free to let me know *or* write it yourself and submit a pull request. It would be greatly appreciated!

## About the source

Each folder is essentially a working build of the content for its corresponding video. There will most likely be differences, like additional comments. However, the core will remain the same to reduce confusion.

## Support

This series is made free of charge for anyone to access on YouTube. The support I receive from Patreon donations and adsense is greatly appreciated. Every subscription, like, and view helps me continue to keep this going and ensure acceptable quality for the foreseable future.

## Credit / Licensing

There is no licensing for any source code in this series. Feel free to copy and paste whatever you want into your project. If you would like to mention this series/my channel as a helpful tool you used, that would be greatly appreciated (but not required!).
